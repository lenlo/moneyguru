"""API to create moneyGuru plugins.

This module was designed to allow developers to easily create plugins for moneyGuru. moneyGuru being
open source, we can already add anything anywhere, but the bar of entry for doing so can be high.

The goal here is to lower the bar of entry by having a simple API to do simple things. Many of the
classes below are either base classes or helper classes. If you want to develop a plugin, this is
the list of classes you can subclass:

* :class:`ReadOnlyTablePlugin`
* :class:`CurrencyProviderPlugin`
